# 20 Questions

A program that plays 20 Questions.

Term project for the course **PM1 Question Processing** at the Universit√§t Potsdam in the summer semester 2020, taught by Dr. Tatjana Scheffler.

Developed by **Wellesley Boboc, Anna-Janina Goecke, Rodrigo Lopez Portillo Alcocer,** and **Elizabeth Pankratz.**

## What it does 

You think of an animal, and our 20 Questions player will try to guess which animal you're thinking of!
If the animal you chose isn't in its knowledge base, the system will add it in, interpolating information about the animal in addition to how you described it.
